### Core Agentic Prompts Built

#### 1. classify_issue.md (Level 2)
**Purpose**: Classify GitHub issues as feature/bug/chore
**Sections**: Metadata, Purpose, Variables, Workflow, Report
**Output**: `/feature`, `/bug`, or `/chore`

**Key Features**:
- Clear classification rules with keywords
- Examples for each type
- Default fallback logic
- Clean output format

#### 2. feature.md (Level 2)
**Purpose**: Create detailed implementation plan for new features
**Sections**: Metadata, Purpose, Variables, Instructions, Workflow, Plan Format, Report
**Output**: `specs/issue-{N}-adw-{ID}-plan-{name}.md`

**Key Features**:
- Research-first approach
- Phase breakdown (Foundation → Core → Integration)
- Step-by-step task ordering
- Testing strategy throughout
- Validation commands
- Acceptance criteria

#### 3. bug.md (Level 2)
**Purpose**: Create plan to fix bugs with root cause analysis
**Sections**: Same structure as feature.md
**Output**: `specs/issue-{N}-adw-{ID}-bugfix-{name}.md`

**Key Features**:
- Reproduction steps
- Root cause analysis
- Minimal fix approach
- Regression prevention tests
- Diagnosis before solution

#### 4. chore.md (Level 2)
**Purpose**: Plan maintenance tasks (refactor, docs, deps)
**Sections**: Same structure as feature.md
**Output**: `specs/issue-{N}-adw-{ID}-chore-{name}.md`

**Key Features**:
- Current vs desired state
- Motivation and value
- Zero regression focus
- Internal quality improvements

#### 5. implement.md (Level 5 Higher-order)
**Purpose**: Execute implementation from any plan file
**Sections**: Metadata, Purpose, Variables, Instructions, Workflow, Guidelines, Report
**Input**: Plan file path (dynamic)
**Output**: Implemented code + status report

**Key Features**:
- Reads and follows plan exactly
- TodoWrite integration for tracking
- Task-by-task execution
- Test-as-you-go approach
- Pattern matching from existing code
- Comprehensive validation
- **This is the "prompt that takes a prompt"** - Level 5 Higher-order pattern

## 🎯 Agentic Principles Applied

Following TAC-11 Lesson:

1. ✅ **Consistent Structure** - All prompts use same sections
2. ✅ **Input → Workflow → Output** - Clear data flow every prompt
3. ✅ **The Trifecta** - Written for you, team, and agents
4. ✅ **Workflow is King** - Step-by-step numbered tasks
5. ✅ **Composable Sections** - Only include what's needed
6. ✅ **Static & Dynamic Variables** - Clear separation
7. ✅ **Direct Agent Communication** - "You are...", "Create...", "Follow..."

## 📐 Prompt Level Breakdown

| Prompt | Level | Sections | Purpose |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| classify_issue.md | 2 | M, P, V, W, R | Workflow prompt - sequential classification |
| feature.md | 2 | M, P, V, I, W, PF, R | Workflow prompt - planning sequence |
| bug.md | 2 | M, P, V, I, W, PF, R | Workflow prompt - bugfix sequence |
| chore.md | 2 | M, P, V, I, W, PF, R | Workflow prompt - maintenance sequence |
| implement.md | 5 | M, P, V, I, W, G, R | Higher-order - executes dynamic plans |

**Legend**: M=Metadata, P=Purpose, V=Variables, I=Instructions, W=Workflow, PF=Plan Format, G=Guidelines, R=Report

## 📊 Complexity Scoring

From TAC-11 Lesson Tier List:

| Component | Usefulness | Skill Required |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Title | C | D |
| Purpose | B | D |
| Variables | A | B |
| Workflow | **S** | C |
| Report | B | C |
| Plan Format (Template) | A | A |
| Higher-order Pattern | B | A |

**Our prompts emphasize Workflow (S-tier) and use clear Variables (A-tier)**

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Phase 2: ADW Orchestration (In Progress)
- [ ] Copy ADW Python modules from invoiceDB
- [ ] Adapt for prior-auth-fastlane structure
- [ ] Create requirements.txt
- [ ] Test manual execution

### Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Create test GitHub issue
- [ ] Run classify → feature → implement manually
- [ ] Validate plan generation
- [ ] Validate code generation
- [ ] Fix any template issues

### Phase 4: Automation
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Set up cron trigger (every 5 min)
- [ ] Test autonomous execution
- [ ] Monitor and iterate

### Phase 5: Production
- [ ] Break plan.md into ~15 GitHub issues
- [ ] Add `/adw_sdlc_iso` to each
- [ ] Let agents build the app
- [ ] Only fix template issues

## 🎓 What Makes This Clear & Agentic

### Clarity
- **Consistent sections** - Same structure = less cognitive load
- **Direct language** - "Create a plan", not "You might want to consider planning"
- **Explicit workflows** - Numbered steps, no ambiguity
- **Clear outputs** - Exactly what to return, how to format it

### Agentic Power
- **Composability** - Mix sections as needed
- **Reusability** - Same prompts for any issue of that type
- **Chaining** - Plan → Implement → Test → Review
- **State tracking** - ADW state flows between phases
- **Isolation** - Git worktrees prevent conflicts
- **Autonomy** - Can run end-to-end without human

### The Pattern
```
GitHub Issue
    ↓
classify_issue (Level 2)
    ↓
feature/bug/chore (Level 2) → Plan File
    ↓
implement (Level 5) ← reads Plan File
    ↓
Implemented Code
```

## 💡 Key Insights from TAC-11

1. **"The prompt is the fundamental unit of engineering"**
   - We're building a library of reusable prompts
   - Each prompt does one thing exceptionally well

2. **"Consistency beats complexity"**
   - Same structure every time reduces confusion
   - Agents perform better with predictable patterns

3. **"Workflow section is S-tier"**
   - Most valuable section in any prompt
   - Step-by-step plays drive deterministic results

4. **"Higher-order prompts scale you"**
   - implement.md takes any plan and executes it
   - One prompt → thousands of features

5. **"Write for the trifecta"**
   - You: Can understand 6 months later
   - Team: Can modify and extend
   - Agents: Can execute reliably

## 📈 Success Metrics

What "works agentically" means:
- ✅ Agent can classify issues 95%+ accuracy
- ✅ Plans contain all info needed to implement
- ✅ Implementation follows plan without human input
- ✅ Tests pass on first try 80%+ of time
- ✅ Zero involvement mode works end-to-end

## 🚀 Vision

Once complete, this will work:

```bash
# Human creates issue
gh issue create --title "Feature: Email Ingestion" \
  --body "Implement email ingestion from Mailgun... /adw_sdlc_iso"

# Cron agent (every 5 min)
# → Detects issue
# → Runs ADW orchestrator
# → Plan → Build → Test → Review → Document → Ship
# → Auto-merges PR
# → Closes issue

# Human: ☕ (zero involvement)
```

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete ✅
**Next**: Phase 2 ADW Scripts 🔄
**Goal**: Clear, agentic, autonomous development framework
