# Feature: Basic Project Setup

## Metadata

adw_id: test001
issue_json: {"body":"Initialize the Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS 4.0...","number":1,"state":"OPEN","title":"Feature: Basic Project Setup"}

## Feature Description
Initialize a complete Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS 4.0 as the foundation for the Prior-Auth Fastlane MVP. This feature creates the basic project structure, configuration files, and development environment that all subsequent features will build upon. The setup follows the tech stack specified in the main requirements document and includes proper tooling for type-checking, linting, and formatting.

## User Story
As a developer
I want a properly configured Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
So that I can begin implementing features on a solid, modern foundation with type safety and styling capabilities

## Problem Statement
Currently, there is no application codebase for the Prior-Auth Fastlane MVP. We need to establish the foundational project structure with the correct technology stack (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4.0, Bun) and development tooling before any features can be implemented.

## Solution Statement
Initialize a Next.js 15 project using the App Router with TypeScript, configure Tailwind CSS 4.0, set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality, create a logical folder structure (app/, components/, lib/, types/), and provide comprehensive documentation in the README. Use Bun as the package manager for fast dependency installation and script execution.

## Relevant Files

Currently no files exist in the application codebase. This feature will create the foundational structure.

### New Files
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind CSS 4.0 configuration
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration for Tailwind
- `.eslintrc.json` - ESLint configuration
- `.prettierrc` - Prettier configuration
- `next.config.js` - Next.js configuration
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with Tailwind imports
- `app/page.tsx` - Home page
- `app/globals.css` - Global styles with Tailwind directives
- `components/.gitkeep` - Placeholder for components directory
- `lib/.gitkeep` - Placeholder for utility functions
- `types/.gitkeep` - Placeholder for TypeScript types
- `public/.gitkeep` - Placeholder for static assets
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
Initialize the Next.js 15 project with TypeScript using the official create-next-app command configured for the App Router. Install and configure Bun as the package manager. Set up the basic project structure with empty directories for future organization.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
Install and configure Tailwind CSS 4.0 with PostCSS. Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency. Create the root layout and home page with Tailwind styling to verify the setup works. Configure TypeScript with strict mode enabled.

### Phase 3: Integration
Create placeholder directories (components/, lib/, types/) for future code organization. Write comprehensive README documentation explaining the project setup, available scripts, and folder structure. Verify all development commands work correctly (dev server, build, type-check, lint).

## Step by Step Tasks

IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### Task 1: Initialize Next.js 15 Project
- Run `bun create next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --app --no-src-dir`
- Select options: TypeScript (yes), ESLint (yes), Tailwind CSS (yes), App Router (yes), Import alias (@/*)
- Verify package.json was created with Next.js 15 dependencies

### Task 2: Verify and Configure Bun
- Ensure bun.lock exists (created automatically)
- Update package.json scripts if needed to use `bun` instead of `npm`
- Test: `bun install` should complete without errors

### Task 3: Configure TypeScript
- Review tsconfig.json
- Ensure strict mode is enabled: `"strict": true`
- Verify paths are configured: `"paths": { "@/*": ["./*"] }`
- Add additional strict options if needed

### Task 4: Configure Tailwind CSS 4.0
- Verify tailwind.config.ts includes app directory in content paths
- Check app/globals.css has Tailwind directives (@tailwind base, components, utilities)
- Ensure PostCSS config exists with Tailwind plugin

### Task 5: Set Up ESLint and Prettier
- Create .eslintrc.json with Next.js recommended config
- Create .prettierrc with consistent formatting rules (semi: false, singleQuote: true, etc.)
- Add Prettier ESLint integration to avoid conflicts
- Add lint scripts to package.json: `"lint": "next lint"`, `"format": "prettier --write ."`

### Task 6: Create Folder Structure
- Create `components/` directory with .gitkeep
- Create `lib/` directory with .gitkeep for utility functions
- Create `types/` directory with .gitkeep for shared TypeScript types
- Verify `app/` and `public/` directories exist

### Task 7: Create Basic Pages
- Update app/layout.tsx with proper metadata and Tailwind setup
- Update app/page.tsx with a simple welcome page
- Add some Tailwind classes to verify CSS is working
- Ensure no TypeScript errors

### Task 8: Write README Documentation
- Update README.md with:
  - Project overview and purpose
  - Tech stack list (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4.0, Bun)
  - Getting started instructions
  - Available scripts (dev, build, lint, format, type-check)
  - Folder structure explanation
  - Link to main plan.md for full requirements

### Task 9: Validation
- Run all validation commands below
- Verify dev server starts without errors
- Verify build completes successfully
- Confirm type-check passes with zero errors
- Ensure all linting passes

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
No unit tests required for this foundational setup task. Future features will add Jest or Vitest configuration.

### Integration Tests
Manual verification that:
- Development server runs and displays the home page
- Tailwind CSS classes are applied and styled correctly
- TypeScript types are checked without errors
- Build process completes and generates production bundle

### Edge Cases
- Bun compatibility with Next.js 15
- Tailwind CSS 4.0 compatibility with Next.js
- TypeScript strict mode catching potential issues
- ESLint and Prettier working together without conflicts

## Acceptance Criteria
- Next.js 15 project is initialized with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4.0 is installed and functioning
- ESLint and Prettier are configured
- Folder structure (app/, components/, lib/, types/, public/) exists
- README documents the project setup and scripts
- `bun install` completes without errors
- `bun run dev` starts development server successfully
- `bun run build` produces production build without errors
- `bun run lint` passes with no errors
- TypeScript compilation passes with no errors

## Validation Commands

Execute every command to validate the feature works correctly with zero regressions.

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Type check
bun tsc --noEmit

# Lint code
bun run lint

# Format code (check)
bun prettier --check .

# Build for production
bun run build

# Start development server (manual verification)
bun run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000 and verify page loads with Tailwind styling
```

## Notes
- This is the absolute foundation - all other features depend on this being correct
- Bun is specified as the package manager for performance (faster than npm/pnpm)
- Next.js 15 uses the App Router (not Pages Router)
- Tailwind CSS 4.0 is the latest major version with performance improvements
- Keep the initial setup minimal - don't add unnecessary dependencies yet
- Future features will add: database (Neon Postgres), auth (Neon Auth), deployment (Vercel), etc.
- This setup does NOT include any business logic - purely infrastructure
